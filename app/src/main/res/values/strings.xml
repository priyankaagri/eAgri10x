\nb) purchase a product on the Platform;
\nc) use the Platform;
\nd) review one of the products or post content to public pages on the Platform;

Please note that the Company may use third party service providers to help operate the Platform and to provide analytical data with respect to the Platform of the Company and these third-party service providers may collect Personal Information from the Platform for these purposes.
\n\nRegistering of an Account: The Platform gives the option of creating a user account (“Account”) as a farmer, trader, FPO and buyer. If the Data Subject decides to create an Account, they will provide the Company with certain Personal Information, such as first and last name, email address and password, phone number, business name, commodity interested in, location, crop name, selling month and quantity and any other information regarding seller and buyer. The Data Subjects are not required to register to use the Platform. However, the Company collects personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from the Data Subject when they set up a free account. While the Data Subject can browse some sections of Company’s Platform without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. The Company also uses contact information to send offers based on previous orders and interests of the Data Subjects.

Additionally, they may encounter “cookies” or other similar devices on certain pages of the said Platform that are placed by third parties. The Company does not control the use of cookies by third parties. The Company may also collect Personal Data automatically about Data Subject using cookies or other similar tracking technologies located in any Agri10x Platform, application, software or similar electronic system Company-issued or Company-authorized.

         \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">4. MINIMUM COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</font>
\n\nAgri10x limits the Personal Data it collects and Processes to the minimum amount necessary for an appropriate business purpose. Personal Data shall be Processed only by those Employees who have an authorized business purpose to Process such Personal Data (“Authorized Employees”), consistent with their roles and responsibilities. Before collecting or Processing Personal Data, Authorized Employees shall analyse whether the business purpose can be satisfied without collecting and Processing Personal Data. In many cases, anonymous (or de-identified) data (which does not identify a Data Subject and cannot be re-identified) will be sufficient. Aggregated numerical information (such as statistical survey data) which includes only anonymous data should be used for many types of reports. If the use of anonymous data is not possible, considering the purpose for which the data is being used, then pseudonymous data which cannot be attributed to a Data Subject without the use of additional information should be used. In this case, the additional information must be kept separately to ensure that the Personal Data cannot be directly linked to an identifiable individual. In those cases where the business purpose can be achieved by eliminating certain data elements, by anonymizing or aggregating data, then Authorized Employees should use all reasonable efforts to use pseudonymous data or to collect or Process the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary in order to achieve the purpose.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">5. ACCURACY AND DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</font>
\n\nTo the extent that a Data Subject provides the Company Personal Data, including the Personal Data on a third party platform, they must (i) ensure, on a continuing basis, the accuracy, reliability, and relevancy of such Personal Data, (ii) only collect and provide the Company such Personal Data in accordance with all Laws, including when applicable, in accordance with all data processing notice and consent requirements, and (iii) inform the third parties whose Personal Data they provide to the Company, or who the third party directly provides the Company to facilitate or engage in a personal, non-business, related function, that the Company will collect and retain such Personal Data in accordance with this Policy, which may be amended from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, Data Subjects must, promptly and without delay, notify the Company (preferably in writing) of any amendments that need to be made to Personal Data to ensure its accuracy, reliability, and relevancy, and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to keep Personal Data accurate, current and reliable for its intended use. To the extent required by Law, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that any Personal Data that are inaccurate, unreliable, or irrelevant having regard to the purposes for which they are Processed, are corrected, amended, or deleted without undue delay.
\n\nData Subjects may have certain rights in relation to their Personal Data under the Law. These rights are generally not absolute and may be subject to certain exceptions or qualifications. The Company will comply with Law to ensure that Data Subjects are able to exercise their rights in relation to their Personal Data. The following paragraphs describe common Data Subject rights that apply in some jurisdictions. In order to exercise those Data Subject rights, such Data Subject should contact the Company at info@agri10x.com.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">6. RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION</font>
\n\nPersonal Data shall be retained only as long as needed to meet the purposes for which it has been collected unless different retention periods apply under Law. After the Personal Data has fulfilled the purposes for which it was collected, the Personal Data should be securely deleted or destroyed, unless retention is otherwise required by Law.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">7. TECHNICAL, PHYSICAL, AND ORGANIZATIONAL SAFEGUARDS</font>
\n\nIn General: The Company protects Personal Data by applying reasonable technical, physical, and organizational safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to or acquisition or disclosure of Personal Data or any accidental loss, alteration, destruction or damage to Personal Data. These safeguards take into account applicable industry standards, the practicality of the protection, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data being protected and are appropriate to the risks posed by the relevant Processing activities, including the risk of exposure to loss, theft or unauthorized use or access of Personal Data.
\n\nPhysical and Electronic Security: The Company endeavours to safeguard and protect the Data Subject’s Personal Information. When the Data Subjects make Personal Information available to the Company, their Personal Information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Information offline). Access to their Personal Information is strictly limited, and the Company takes reasonable security measures to ensure that the Personal Information is not accessible to the public. All of the Personal Information is restricted in offices, as well as the offices of third-party service providers. Only Employees or third-party agents who need Personal Information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Information. The Employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all the Personal Information. Employees not adhering to this Policy are subject to disciplinary action. The servers that the Company stores user Personal Information on are kept in a secure physical environment. Agri10x also has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under control.
\n\nReporting of Incidents: Data Subjects should immediately (and in any case no later than 24 hours after discovery) report any actual or suspected compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Personal Data or the systems or databases on which the Personal Data is stored, transmitted or Processed; including, but not limited to, any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or acquisition of, or access to, any Personal Data (each, an “Incident”) to the Chief Privacy Officer regardless of the magnitude of the Incident or the type of Personal Data involved.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">8. LAWFUL PROCESSING</font>
\n\nConditions for Processing: The Company Processes Personal Data in accordance with Law. To the extent required by Law, the Company will notify Data Subjects of the legal basis on which the Company relies in order to Process their Personal Data.
\n\nAdherence to Consent Requirements: Whenever the Company’s policies, Law, or contractual obligations require the Company to obtain consent from the Data Subject(s) for the collection, use, Processing, transfer or sharing of Personal Data, the Company shall comply with those requirements. By accessing the Platform or otherwise using the Platform, the relevant Data Subject expressly consents to Company’s collection, storage, use, Processing and disclosure of the Information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
\n\nRight of Revocation: Where the Company relies on consent for Processing Personal Data for a particular purpose, Data Subjects shall have the right to revoke their consent at any time, whereupon the Company shall cease Processing of the Personal Data for that purpose. The revocation of consent will not invalidate the lawfulness of Processing carried out before the revocation was made. The Company shall be entitled to continue its Processing of Personal Data if required or permitted by Law and for other purposes in relation to which the Data Subject has not revoked consent.
\n\nProvision of Personal Data when Required: If a Data Subject refuses to provide the Company with certain Personal Data, this may hamper the Company’s ability to, or prevent the Company from being able to, furnish certain services to the Data Subject. For example, under certain circumstances, the Personal Data may be required in order for an Employee to receive, or the Company perform, necessary, critical, or statutory services (such as payroll, employment benefits, travel and expense reimbursement, tax and other human resource- related obligations), all of which will be done in accordance with the Company’s policies and Law. Where the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, the Company will inform the Data Subject of this fact and of the possible consequences of not providing the Personal Data.
\n\nExtraordinary Circumstances: In some cases, where authorized or required by Law, the Company may collect, use or disclose Personal Data without requesting consent, providing notice or offering an opportunity to object to the Processing of the Personal Data, such as in the course of an investigation of possible wrongdoing or in emergency situations. To the extent required by Law, the Company will notify the Data Subject of the Processing as soon as possible thereafter.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">9. PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA AND SENSITIVE IDENTIFICATION DATA</font>
\n\nHigher Level of Protection: Because of the nature of Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data, the Company’s policies and procedures, as well as Law in certain cases, require that a higher level of protection be applied to it compared to Personal Data that is not sensitive.
\n\nProtection Protocols: The Company shall apply a higher level of security to Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data reflecting the correspondingly greater risks arising from the unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of such information. In particular:
\n\nAny hard copies of documents or any tangible materials containing Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data shall be locked in a file cabinet or closet or shall be secured against unauthorized access by other means.
\n\nSensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data shall not be stored on removable storage media such as laptops, CDs, DVDs, USB storage devices or mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets) unless the data is encrypted.
\n\nSensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data shall be encrypted at rest and in transit.
\n\nSensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data shall not be transferred, even temporarily, to an Employee’s home computer, an Employee’s personal email account, or any Internet website or any other unauthorized electronic equipment without the approval of the Chief Privacy Officer and, in such cases, the Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Identification Data shall be encrypted.
\n\nThe Company does not use Sensitive Identification Data except when absolutely required for legitimate business purposes, including, but not limited to, Employee benefits and tax purposes, when required by Law or upon prior written approval of the Chief Privacy Officer.

              \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">10. ELECTRONIC MONITORING</font>
\n\nTo the extent permitted by Law, Agri10x reserves the right to monitor and audit Employees’ use of all Company Information Resources and the information stored on or transmitted through these Information Resources to the extent required for an appropriate business purpose (including the protection of Company property). Unless Law provides otherwise, Employees should have no expectation of privacy around their use of the Company’s Information Resources or the Personal Data they store on or transmit through these Information Resources. Any electronic monitoring of Personal Data will be conducted in accordance with Law, applicable works council or collective bargaining agreements, and with the approval of the Chief Privacy Officer. To the extent required by Law, Employees will receive notice of the scope and extent of Company’s electronic monitoring. Employees should not implement any electronic monitoring practices, including monitoring of phone calls, emails and instant messaging communications, without the prior written consent of the Chief Privacy Officer.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">11. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO A THIRD PARTY</font>
\n\nThe Company may share Personal Data with third parties in compliance with Law. With respect to Personal Data of Data Subjects, such third parties may include other Company entities, service providers, business customers, regulated entities to which the Company provides products and/or services, entities that may acquire portions of the business, and regulatory authorities.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">12. COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY</font>
\n\nAll the Data Subjects are expected to comply with this Policy.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">13. CONCERNS AND APPEALS</font>
\n\nThe Company takes reasonable steps to permit Employees to raise concerns about the manner in which it Processes Personal Data. If an Employee has a concern about the Company’s collection or Processing of Personal Data, the Employee should notify one of the following: the Company at info@agri10x.com or the Chief Privacy Officer. A Data Subject such as a customer, FPO, farmer or trader may also raise concerns with the Company about how it Processes the Personal Data, which concerns will be addressed in an appropriate manner in accordance with Law. Agri10x shall provide and notify these subjects of an appropriate contact mechanism who has questions about the Company’s handling of Personal Data as well as, if applicable, with the contact details of the Chief Privacy Officer or any similar person responsible for the protection of their Personal Data.

        \n\n<font color="black" face="proxima_nova_alt_bold" size="18">14. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND PRACTICES</font>
\n\nThe Company reserves the right to change or update this Policy at any time by posting a notice on the Platform that the Company is changing its Privacy Policy. If the manner in which it uses Personal Information changes, Agri10x will notify Data Subjects by: (a) sending the modified policy via e-mail; and/or (b) by any other reasonable means acceptable under applicable Law. The Data Subjects will have a choice as to whether or not they want to opt-in to such use.

\n\nThis Policy is administered by Company’s Chief Privacy Officer.
